year while it lasts. The machine costs Rs. 6000 and will have a
salvage value of Rs. 2000 when it is condemned. If 9 percent per
annum can be earned on alternate investments, write a program to
determine what will be the minimum life of the machine to make it
a more attractive investment compared to alternative investment?*/
