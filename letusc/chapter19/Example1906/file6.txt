To understand how this program works, you need to be familiar with the 
concept of pointers. A pointer is initiated whenever we open a file. On 
opening a file, a pointer is set up which points to the first record in the

pointer returned by fopen( ) points to. On using the function either
fread( ) or fwrite( ), the pointer moves to the beginning of the next 
record. On closing a file the pointer is deactivated. Note that the pointer 
movement is of utmost importance si
